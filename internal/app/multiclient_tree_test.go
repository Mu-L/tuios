// A BSP tree is built by a client and needed by every client on the session:
// it is what the dividers between shared-border panes are read from, and it is
// what the next retile lays the panes out from. The daemon never builds one; it
// stores whichever a client last pushed and hands it on.
//
// These tests hold two full clients on one session and watch what one client's
// tree does to the other's. The report they exist for: a peer that watched
// tiling turn on drew a box around every borderless pane, with a blank column
// where the divider should be, and its first retile then built a tree of its
// own that disagreed with the one it had been sent.
//
// NEGATIVE CONTROLS, each run by mutating the shipped code and watching the
// named assertion fail:
//
//   - ApplyStateSyncFrom adopting the tree from a strictly newer state only
//     (adoptTopology := newerState), which is the tree before this fix:
//     TestAPeerAdoptsATreeAnotherClientBuilt fails in settleGeometry, the
//     pair never agreeing on one arithmetic because the peer's panes keep a
//     border of their own (118x17 against 120x19) after tiling turned on -
//     which is the frame in the report, a box around every borderless pane.
//   - The exchange applying every sync as the daemon's own
//     (ApplyStateSync(state) in place of ApplyStateSyncFrom): the peer holds
//     a side-by-side tree while the client that built it holds a stacked one,
//     which is what binds the test to the origin reaching the client rather
//     than to the gate alone.
//   - adoptTopology answering true for every sync, so the echo gate is gone:
//     TestAPeerKeepsItsOwnTreeAgainstADaemonEcho fails saying a same-version
//     echo from the daemon replaced the stacked tree with the side-by-side one.
