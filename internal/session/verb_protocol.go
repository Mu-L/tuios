// and one response per line, either

// strings so a caller never has to cross-reference a numeric table. The binary
// gob/PTY fast path is untouched; a connection is detected as JSON or binary
// from its first byte on accept (see detectJSONClient).

// VerbProtocolVersion is the version of the JSON verb protocol. It is reported

// on an incompatible change to the envelope or to an existing verb's contract;
// adding a new verb is backward compatible and does not require a bump.
